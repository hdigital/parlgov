We moved the sources of the ParlGov static page to a new GitHub repository at
[github.com/hdigital/parlgov](https://github.com/hdigital/parlgov).

The page was previously a part of [ParlGov
snippets](https://github.com/hdigital/parlgov-snippets/); see [post
15/09/2021](/2021/09/15/static-parlgov-web-page/).

We updated some of the information and added a post; see
[commits](https://github.com/hdigital/parlgov/commits/main/).

A [readme](https://github.com/hdigital/parlgov/blob/main/README.md) file
documents how we create the static page with
[blogdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/).

Posts until [12/08/2024](/2024/08/12/parlgov-2024-released/) are based on the
ParlGov legacy page database. We added later posts manually.
