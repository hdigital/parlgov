We have added the 2024 stable version to the [ParlGov Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/parlgov/).

The 2024 version includes all elections and cabinets until June 2023. The release includes a SQLite database with some additional information and a pdf-copy of the codebook.

Many thanks to Alexandra Quaas and Maike Hesse for important help to finalize the release.
