We added a [ParlGov
snippet](https://github.com/hdigital/parlgov-snippets/tree/main/coalitions-potential)
that creates a dataset of potential coalitions and their parameters.

This code has a long history and was written for work published in
Thürk/Hellström/Döring (2021). Initially, a Python script was developed in the
project to calculate the potential coalitions. Later, several revisions were
prepared with Tidyverse-R, and the last revision was in 2022. For the version
added to ParlGov Snippets, we used data from the [2024
release](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/2VZ5ZC)
and made minor code updates.

In addition, we added another [ParlGov
snippet](https://github.com/hdigital/parlgov-snippets/tree/main/party-family-share)
to visualize the vote share of party families since 1900. This snippet also has
a longer history and is based on old [teaching
material](https://github.com/hdigital/teaching/tree/main/1-courses/).
