A new version of the ParlGov website is available at
[parlgov.fly.dev](https://parlgov.fly.dev/).

The site is a minimal reimplementation of the ParlGov legacy site
â€” see [post 15/09/2021](/2021/09/15/static-parlgov-web-page/).

A [migration guide](https://hdigital.github.io/parlgov-web/migration/) provides
information about the scope of the project and the data that has been migrated.

The open-source code and a working paper introducing the new version will be
published later this year.
