title: Defector parties column for cabinets
---

The table cab*party now includes an additional column to code defector parties. With this observation we indicate if a party left a governing coaliton. Including this variable was inspired by Tavits' 2008 paper \_The Role of Parties’ Past Behavior in Coalition Formation*.
