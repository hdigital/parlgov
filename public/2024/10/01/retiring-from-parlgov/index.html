      <p>Today, I (Holger) retire from ParlGov.</p>
<p>It has been a project that I have worked on for almost two decades. I found the
first mention of the project name in a file from 2006 and a first version of the
Django app from 2007. All changes since mid-2009 are documented in news entries,
among them new major versions of the site in
<a href="http://localhost:4321/2010/02/25/parlgov-10/02-online/">2010</a> and
<a href="/2014/12/21/new-webpage-at-www.parlgov.org/">2014</a>. This year, I completed a
minimal new version of the <a href="https://parlgov.fly.dev/">site</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, we updated the data until June 2023 with the previous team of data
editors. Thanks again, <a href="/data-info/">Alexandra and Meike</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/2VZ5ZC">stable
release</a>
is the last version of the ParlGov data, which has received contributions from
several data editors and suggestions from colleagues over the years.</p>
<p><a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=10437084&amp;version=1.0">parlgov-experimental.db</a>
includes all public information from the project. All other information (data
tables, news, docs, news entries, etc.) is derived from it. The last version
also includes (incomplete) information on confidence votes, support parties, and
additional documentation.</p>
<p>I plan to keep the <a href="https://parlgov.fly.dev/">new site</a>, with the data until
2023, online as long as it needs only security updates.</p>
<p>Both project maintainers keep copies of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>an archive of document sources (several thousand files)</li>
<li>versions of the entire SQLite database (including additional data)</li>
<li>a Docker image archive to run the legacy app</li>
</ul>
<p>If feasible, I put some of this information into a public data archive with
(very) restricted access. Again, all important data from the project is in
&lsquo;parlgov-experimental.db&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I am about to complete a working paper that introduces the new ParlGov site and
provides my perspective on this type of data infrastructure in political science
research based on my experience through the project.</p>
<p>With ParlGov, we have received wide recognition and many citations. Many
scholars provided inspiration or pointed out errors. Thanks. We were less
successful in gaining research grants for the project.</p>
<p>Personally, I learned a lot through the project about science, data,
collaborations, programming, politics, and much more. Thanks!</p>
